// 10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.

/*
About this program:
In this program, I have added single quotation marks ('') instead of double quotation marks ("") in 'console.log();' to use double quotation marks in the sentence I wanted to print. If I had added double quotation marks in 'console.log();', I would not be able to add double quotation marks in the sentence I wanted to print.

About this program:
